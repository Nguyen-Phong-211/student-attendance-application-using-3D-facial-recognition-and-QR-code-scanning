## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

### 1. Environment Setup

- Python 3.13.5
- Redis
- Django, Django Channels, required packages

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nguyen-Phong-211/attend3d.git
cd attend3d
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Install and Start Redis

```bash
# MacOS
brew install redis
brew services start redis

# Ubuntu
sudo apt update && sudo apt install redis-server
sudo systemctl enable redis-server.service
sudo systemctl start redis-server
```

### Note: To push tables on PostgreSQL. You must do this
```bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations [app_name]
python3 manage.py migrate [app_name]
```

### 3. Initialize Sample Data

Create seed commands similar to Laravel for generating sample data:

```bash
python manage.py seed_role
python manage.py seed_room
python manage.py seed_department
python manage.py seed_major
python manage.py seed_academic_year
python manage.py seed_semester
python manage.py seed_class
python manage.py seed_subject
python manage.py seed_shift
python manage.py seed_lesson_slot
python manage.py seed_schedule
```

**Note:**  
- Ensure `__init__.py` exists in both `management/` and `commands/` folders so Django recognizes the commands.
- Seed files are located in `[app_name]/management/commands/`.

### 4. Run the Real-time Server

```bash
daphne attend3d.asgi:application
# Or
daphne -b 127.0.0.1 -p 8000 attend3d.asgi:application
```

---
```bash
python manage.py runserver but for react, you must still run npm start then you change url on browser that is http://127.0.0.1:3000
File's changes are accounts/authentication.py (create), accounts/views.py, accounts/urls.py, attend3d/settings.py, frontend/src/utils/auth.js and frontend/src/api/axiosInstance.js
```

### 5. DJANGO CRONTAB
The project uses **django-crontab** to run periodic tasks (cron jobs) on the server. For example, automatically approving course registrations after 24 hours if they have not been processed by an administrator.

```bash
pip install django-crontab

-- Set up in settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_crontab',
]

CRONJOBS = [
    # Run every hour to check for subscriptions over 24 hours
    ('0 * * * *', 'student.cron.auto_approve_registrations')
]

--
python manage.py crontab add # add cronjob to system
python manage.py crontab show # view current cronjob
python manage.py crontab remove # remove cronjob
```

## To run environment python
source env/bin/activate

## To download and install all libraries
pip freeze > requirements.txt
