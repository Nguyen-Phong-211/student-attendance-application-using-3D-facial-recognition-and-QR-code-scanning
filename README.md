## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

### 1. Environment Setup

- Python 3.13.5
- Redis
- Django, Django Channels, required packages

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nguyen-Phong-211/attend3d.git
cd attend3d
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Install and Start Redis

```bash
# MacOS
brew install redis
brew services start redis

# Ubuntu
sudo apt update && sudo apt install redis-server
sudo systemctl enable redis-server.service
sudo systemctl start redis-server
```

### 3. Initialize Sample Data

Create seed commands similar to Laravel for generating sample data:

```bash
python manage.py seed_role
python manage.py seed_room
python manage.py seed_department
python manage.py seed_major
python manage.py seed_academic_year
python manage.py seed_semester
python manage.py seed_class
python manage.py seed_subject
python manage.py seed_shift
python manage.py seed_lesson_slot
```

**Note:**  
- Ensure `__init__.py` exists in both `management/` and `commands/` folders so Django recognizes the commands.
- Seed files are located in `[app_name]/management/commands/`.

### 4. Run the Real-time Server

```bash
daphne attend3d.asgi:application
# Or
daphne -b 127.0.0.1 -p 8000 attend3d.asgi:application
```
